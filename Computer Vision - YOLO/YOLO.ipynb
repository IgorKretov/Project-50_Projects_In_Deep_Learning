The first step in NMS is to remove all the predicted bounding boxes that have a detection probability that is less than a given NMS threshold.  In the code below, we set this NMS threshold to `0.6`. This means that all predicted bounding boxes that have a detection probability less than 0.6 will be removed. "

We detect the objects using the `detect_objects(m, resized_image, iou_thresh, nms_thresh)`function from the `utils` module.

The `detect_objects()` function also prints out the time it took for the YOLO algorithm to detect the objects in the image and the number of objects detected. Since we are running the algorithm on a CPU it takes about 2 seconds to detect the objects in an image, however, if we were to use a GPU it would run much faster.\n",

The `plot_boxes()`function uses the same color to plot the bounding boxes of the same object class.

In the cell below, we have repeated some of the code used before in order to prevent you from scrolling up down when you want to change the `iou_thresh` and `nms_thresh`parameters or the image.
